The Java WebServer was running on a AWS Elastic Beanstalk Tomcat Environment. A .war file was deployed to this environment.
The database was a MySQL database hosted using AWS RDS.

Design Patterns:

Singleton - The ApiRequest Swift class was using the singleton pattern so it did not need to be reinstantiated everytime a api call was made.

MVC - Model View Controller was used on the client side (iOS app).

Facade - The server was abstracted from the client so that only information that the client needed was available. The logic was abstracted away.

Observer - There was a publisher subscriber relationship with the client being the publisher and the webserver being the subscriber. The client would push updates to the webserver.
